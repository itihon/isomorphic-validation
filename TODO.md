# TODO


    ## Chores

        - [ ] change double quotes to single quotes in eslint.config.mjs and try to amend the commit in which eslint have been configured

        - [ ] remove test commit

        - [ ] publish a new version of the library since preventCyclicSubscriptions feature has been added



    ## Features

        - [ ] add boolean parameter clone with default value true to the group and glue functions (group([validations], clone = true))


    ## Refactor

        - [ ] consider renaming ObserverAnd to something like AndGate

        

    ## Tests

        - [ ] require/import test to check CJS/ESM compatibility


    ## Bugs


    ## Docs


        - [ ] add jsdoc (one jsdoc declaration for observer-and.js is still in the stash)
